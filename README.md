## What will I see i this build?

ðŸ‘‰ A web application using TypeScript, React, and React Context.

ðŸ‘‰ The program generates a matrix of random numbers and display it in table format.

ðŸ‘‰ The table has an additional column showing the sum of each row and an additional row showing the average of each column.

ðŸ‘‰ You will be able to increase the value of a cell by clicking on it, and the sum and average values will be calculated accordingly.

ðŸ‘‰ You will also be able to place the nearest cells with a value closest to the value in the cell the cursor is on and highlight them.

ðŸ‘‰ You have permission to delete or add a row, and the sum and average values will be recalculated accordingly.

ðŸ‘‰ The app is deployed to a working build on [Netlify](https://memcrab-matrix-test-task.netlify.app/).
